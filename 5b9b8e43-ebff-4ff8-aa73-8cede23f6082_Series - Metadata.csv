EN.GHG.CO2.AG.MT.CE.AR5,CC BY-4.0,Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from Agriculture (Mt CO2e),"A measure of annual emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), one of the six Kyoto greenhouse gases (GHG), from the agricultural sector. This includes emissions from livestock (IPCC 2006 codes 3.A.1 (enteric fermentation, 3.a.2 (manure management) and crops (IPCC 2006 codes 3.C.1 Emissions from biomass burning, 3.C.2 Liming, 3.C.3 Urea application, 3.C.4 Direct N2O Emissions from managed soils, 3.C.5 Indirect N2O Emissions from managed soils, 3.C.6 Indirect N2O Emissions from manure management, 3.C.7 Rice cultivations). The measure is standardized to carbon dioxide equivalent values using the Global Warming Potential (GWP) factors of IPCC's 5th Assessment Report (AR5).","EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research) Community GHG Database, Joint Research Centre (JRC) - European Commission, uri: https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset_ghg2032, publisher: JRC European Commission, date published: 2024;
International Energy Agency (IEA), uri: https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset_ghg2032, publisher: JRC European Commission, date published: 2024",Environment: Emissions,WDI,Mt CO2eq,Annual,Sum,"Methodology: EDGAR compiles data from multiple authoritative sources, including: International Energy Agency (IEA) – Energy consumption data, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) – National GHG inventories, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) – Agricultural emissions, World Bank & National Statistics Offices – Socioeconomic and industrial data, Scientific Literature & IPCC Guidelines – Emission factors and methodologies. 

EDGAR follows the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories to estimate emissions. The core equation is:

?? =??×????

Where:

E = Total emissions (kg, tons, or CO2-equivalent)
A = Activity data (e.g., fuel consumption, production levels)
EF = Emission factor (kg of pollutant per unit of activity)

Depending on the pollutant, different tiers of complexity are used:

Tier 1 – Default IPCC emission factors (simple estimation)
Tier 2 – Country/region-specific emission factors
Tier 3 – Detailed process-based models (highest accuracy)","Anthropogenic (human-caused) emissions of global greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (NO2) and F-gases, lead to an increase of the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which in turn causes atmospheric warming by trapping heat in the atmosphere (greenhouse gas effect). Atmospheric warming leads to climatic changes causing more frequent and extreme weather events and higher temperatures globally, leading to large impacts across the globe and particularly in developing countries that often have a limited means to adapt and build resilience. The international scientific community has warned that emissions need to decline to net zero by the middle of the 21st century to limit global warming to well below a 2deg C increase and help avoid the most consequential climate change impacts. 









Climate change is having a disproportionate impact on developing countries and if unabated will not only reverse past development progress and hinder poverty reduction but will also make future development more costly.

Data on exposure to ambient air pollution are derived from estimates of annual concentrations of very fine particulates produced by the Global Burden of Disease study, an international scientific effort led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. Estimates of annual concentrations are generated by combining data from atmospheric chemistry transport models, satellite observations of aerosols in the atmosphere, and ground-level monitoring of particulates. Overlaying PM2.5 estimates with gridded population data, the percent of a nation's people that lives in areas where PM2.5 concentrations exceed recommended levels is calculated by summing the population for grid cells where PM2.5 concentrations are beyond a threshold value, in this case 10 micrograms per cubic meter, and then dividing by total population.","Air pollution places a major burden on world health. In many places, including cities but also in rural areas, exposure to air pollution is the main environmental threat to health, responsible for 6.5 million deaths per year, about one every 5 seconds.

Cooking and heating with solid fuels create harmful smoke and particles that fill homes and the surrounding environment. Household air pollution from cooking and heating with solid fuels is responsible for 2.9 million deaths a year. Long-term exposure to high levels of fine particles in the air contributes to a range of health effects, including respiratory diseases, lung cancer, and heart disease, resulting in 4.2 million deaths annually.
